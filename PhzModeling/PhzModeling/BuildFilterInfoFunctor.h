 * @details
 * This functor takes the sampling of the filter. It extracts the range of the filter,
 * compute the filter normalization (integration of c*filter(lambda)/lambdaÂ² for the
 * energy case, c*filter(lambda)/lambda for the photons (default) case)
 * and build an interpolated Function representing the filter.
 *
 * Note that the range starts at the last value of Lambda for which the
 * filter has a zero value and ends to the last value of lambda for which
 * the filter value is again 0
