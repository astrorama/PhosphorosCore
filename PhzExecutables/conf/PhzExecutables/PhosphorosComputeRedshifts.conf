# Algorithm Configuration section
#
# Contains options for controlling the algorithm used for the PHZ calculation.
#
# Axes Collapse options:
#
# - axes-collapse-type
#   The method used for collapsing the multidimentional posterior to the 1D PDF.
#   The available options are:
#   SUM      : Simple sum of the probabilities of all models of the same redshift
#              NOTE: The SUM option assumes that all axes of the posterior
#              contain equally distributed values
#   MAX      : Maximum probability of all models of the same redhsift
#              NOTE: The MAX option does not follow beyesian statistics
#   BAYESIAN : Performs integration over the numerical axes. Currently non
#              numerical axes are assumed to contain equally distributed values.
#
#
# Likelihood computation options:
#
# - enable-missing-data
#   Enables or disables the check for photometries flagged as missing. These
#   checks are enabled automatically if a catalog contains at least one source
#   with missing photometries and they have a performance cost of about 5%.
#   The available options are:
#   ON  : Photometries flagged as missing are ignored during the chi square
#         computation (default)
#   OFF : Missing photometry flags are ignored
#
# - enable-upper-limit
#   Enables or disables the correct handling of the photometries flagged as
#   upper limits (no detection). The checks are enabled automatically if a
#   catalog contains at least one source with upper limit. The performance cost
#   of this handling is about 15% for sources without photometries flagged as
#   "no detection" and about 1000% (ten times slower) for sources with. The
#   available options are:
#   ON   : Photometries flagged as upper limits are handled as described in
#          arXiv:1210.0285 (default)
#   FAST : Upper limit probabilities are treated as step functions with value
#          one bellow the upper limit and zero above. This option is faster than
#          the default, but produces worse results, because it does not take in
#          consideration the error.
#   OFF  : Upper limit flags are ignored

#
# SED group for the Luminosity Function options:
#  -luminosity-sed-group-<GROUP_NAME>
#   The luminosity function is defined with respect to some galaxy types (blue
#   versus red galaxy, spiral versus eliptical galaxy,...). On the other hand the
#   galaxy models are given by a set of SEDs. The SED group is the way one
#   associate a sub-set of the SEDs to a galaxy type. A SED Group defined by its
#   name and the (comma separated) list of SED it contains. All the SEDs of the
#   parameter space must belong to exactly one SED-group in order to fully
#   specify the luminosity function.

# Absolute luminosity computation options:
#  -luminosity-filter
#   The name of the filter into which the luminosity is computed.
#
#  -luminosity-function-expressed-in-magnitude

#
#  -luminosity-function-corrected-for-extinction
#   Defines if the absolute luminosity is computed with or without intrinsic
#   reddening.

#   NO (default): The computed luminosity is the one an observer would measure
#                 at 10[pc] of the source.
#   YES         : The computed luminosity is furthermore corrected for
#                  intrinsic reddening (so it is brighter).
#
# Cosmological Parameters options:
#   The cosmology is used to compute the luminosity distance of a model at a
#   given redshift. This process is part of the absolute luminosity determination
#   If one ore multiple of the cosmological parameters is omitted, the default
#   value will be used.

#
#  -luminosity-function-schechter-alpha-<ID>
#   The steepness of the Schechter luminosity function (Mandatory if the
#   function-curve is skipped for this Id)
